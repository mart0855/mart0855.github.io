                <p>This card was made for my aunt who happens to love cats. I used reference to my own cat for this illustration, capturing her bipolar personality perfectly. Always interested in trying new things, I decided to research mechanical cards and learn to make one of my own. Prototyping was an essential step in saving printing costs. The illustration is built up using a minimal colour palette with a blend of different textures to make the figure really "pop".</p></div>
