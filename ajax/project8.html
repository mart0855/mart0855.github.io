                <p>Pet portraiture is a popular subject. Immortalizing the animal in a painting secures their place on their ownersâ€™ wall the same way it has transfixed a place in their hearts. Capturing the character of the animal can be just as difficult as that of a human being, especially during the photography sessions.</p></div>
