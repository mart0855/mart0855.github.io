        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc column2">Winning poster design chosen to represent the college theatre production of The Laramie Project, a play by Moisés Kaufman and members of the Tectonic Theater Project. Based on a true story, the play is a re-interpretation of interview accounts of the people of Laramie, Wyoming which document their reactions after the murder of Matthew Shepard; a hate crime against a gay man. This poster seeks to present the violence in a way that captures the viewer’s attention without totally revealing the details. The copy is set in American Typewriter to further emphasize the setting and serious ‘matter-of-fact’ content of the play. By attracting an audience to the play, the poster played a small role in delivering the message of tolerance in the community.</div>
