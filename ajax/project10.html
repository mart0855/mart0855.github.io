        <div class="cbp-l-inline-desc column2">While working at McMillan, I had the opportunity to design branded assets for a Trend Micro sponsorship campaign. We were tasked to design a print advertisement for Trend Micro that would be presented in the FIFA Women's World Cup 2015 program guide deeming them the unofficial sponsor of all goalkeepers at the games. They would also have booths in Ottawa and Vancouver during the event where they provided awareness about internet security. I worked closeley under Art Director, Taralyn Carver, and Creative Director, Jared Young, who came up with the original concept, #ProtectYourNet, for the campaign. Photo retouching, branding and web design were essential skills I employed while adhering closely to brand guidelines and the "#ProtectYourNet" campaign identity.</div>
