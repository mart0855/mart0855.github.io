            <span>Joining the digital creative team at <em>Rogers Media</em>, I took on a role as the digital designer for one of their licensed companies, <em>Texture™ Canada</em>, a magazine subscription app with unlimited reading.</span>

            <p>I was tasked with designing all of the bilingual digital marketing assets for the Q4 campaigns of 2016. This included web banners, social media ads, email templates, and header images. With so many offers, I made it my mandate to provide consistency across all of the campaigns while highlighting some of the great features <em>Texture</em> had to offer. Developing emails using new technologies such as <em>Movable Ink</em> brought <strong>dynamic</strong> content to eblasts, giving them a competitive edge.</p></div>
