                <span>Using traditional block printing blended with a modern twist of digital manipulation &#8212; carving this timeless fairy tale illustration was a refreshing break from the computer.</span>

                <p>The illustration depicts Little Red Riding Hood being stalked by the Big Bad Wolf within the dark, foreboding forest. Meticulous attention to detail was paid to the direction of the wolf's fur down to the shadows on the grass.</p><p>Planning and precision were practiced while using this traditional method of printmaking. I also gained inspiration from and appreciation for printmakers such as Lon Megargee, Frances Gearhart and Albrecht DÃ¼rer.</p></div>
