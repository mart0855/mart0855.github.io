                <p>The illustration depicts Little Red Riding Hood being stalked by the Big Bad Wolf within the dark, foreboding forest. Meticulous attention to detail was paid to the direction of the wolf's fur down to the shadows on the grass.</p><p>Lessons of planning and precision were learned by practicing this analog method of printmaking. I also gained inspiration from and appreciation for printmakers such as Lon Megargee, Frances Gearhart and Albrecht DÃ¼rer.</p></div>
